# Elo-ladder [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robhoes/elo-ladder.png)](https://travis-ci.org/robhoes/elo-ladder)

_An Elo-rating based ladder competition manager_

The ladder currently has support for two types of games: chess and backgammon,
each with their own rating algorithms.

The chess algorithm is as described on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELO_rating_system.

The backgammon algorithm is the Elo-Kaufman algorithm, as popularised by FIBS.
It is described at http://www.bkgm.com/faq/Ratings.html.


## Getting involved
The results of the ladder are automatically published at

Here you can also find instructions on adding yourself to the ladder and
recording games that you have played.

## Commandline usage

```
NAME
       ladder - An Elo ladder system

SYNOPSIS
       ladder COMMAND ...

COMMANDS
       history
           Compute and print historic ratings of players for plotting

       print
           Compute and print ELO ladder

OPTIONS

           Show this help in format FMT (pager, plain or groff).

       --version
           Show version information.

       Use `ladder COMMAND --help' for help on a specific command.
FILE-FORMATS
       The PLAYERS file should be in CSV format:

       Syntax:
           <ID>,<Full name>,<Elo-rating>,<active>

       Where ID can be any unique string, Elo-rating is the starting
       rating for the player as an integer, and active indicates
       whether the player is retired or not.

       Examples:
           magnus,Magnus Carlsen,2870,true
           X-22,Paul Magriel,1870,true


       The GAMES file should be in CSV format:

       Syntax:
           <Date>,<Player 1's ID>,<Player 2's ID>[,<LENGTH>],<RES>

       Where the date is in ISO 8601 format (yyyy-mm-dd); IDs match those
       listed in the PLAYERS file; and RES is either 1, .5 or 0 in the case of
       a win, draw or loss for Player 1 respectively. For backgammon games,
       LENGTH is the match length (winning score); it may be omitted for chess
       games.

       Examples:
           2013-11-21,magnus,anand,.5
           2013-11-21,X-22,robertie,7,1
